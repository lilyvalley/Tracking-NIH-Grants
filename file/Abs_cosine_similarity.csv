0,"Exercise training is the cornerstone in the prevention and management of hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, blood pressure (BP) response to exercise is exaggerated in hypertension often to the range that raises the safety concern, which may prohibit patients from regular exercise. This augmented pressor response is shown to be related to excessive sympathetic stimulation caused by overactive muscle reflex. Exaggerated sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction further contributes to the rise in BP during exercise in hypertension. Exercise training has been shown to reduce both exercise pressor reflex and attenuate the abnormal vasoconstriction. Hypertension also contributes to cognitive impairment, and exercise training has been shown to improve cognitive function through both BP-dependent and BP-independent pathways. Additional studies are still needed to determine if newer modes of exercise training such as high-intensity interval training may offer advantages over traditional continuous moderate training in improving BP and brain health in hypertensive patients.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertensive patients are known to display exaggerated rise in blood pressure (BP) during exercise but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Normally, exercise is accompanied by decreased parasympathetic activity and increased sympathetic activity caused by central command and activation of thin fiber muscle afferents that reflexively increase sympathetic outflow and BP. Traditionally, muscle afferents were dichotomized as metaboreceptors, which are activated slowly and only during intense or ischemic muscle contraction, or mechanoreceptors, which respond quickly to even mild deformation of their receptive fields. The increase in SNA and BP caused by activation of these receptors, known as exercise pressor reflex, is normally buffered by activation arterial baroreceptors, which are reset to operate at higher BP range but at the same level of sensitivity. Our recent work in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and patients with essential hypertension indicated an exaggerated rise in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and BP during muscle contraction even in the absence of congestive heart failure. Furthermore, the latency of the sympathetic response during exercise is much shorter than normal and the threshold level of exercise intensity required to increase muscle SNA is much lower than normal, implicating mechanoreceptor mediation. Mechanisms responsible for overactive exercise pressor reflex (EPR) in hypertension remain unknown but an increasing body of evidence suggested a role for aldosterone in regulating resting central sympathetic outflow in both hypertensive rats and humans. Furthermore, local aldosterone synthesis in the brain has been shown to contribute to sympathetic activation and hypertension in the SHRs and Dahl-salt sensitive rats despite normal circulating levels of aldosterone. Whether aldosterone contributes to excessive sympathoexcitation and BP elevation during exercise remains unknown. Our pilot data in hypertensive rats and humans with normal and elevated serum aldosterone levels demonstrated a major role of aldosterone on exercise pressor reflex via mechanoreflex sensitization. Therefore, we now propose parallel translational studies in hypertensive rats and patients with primary hypertension and secondary form of hypertension caused by adrenal overproduction of aldosterone (primary aldosteronism), using multiple interventions to directly activate muscle mechanoreceptors, metaboreceptors, or arterial baroreceptors during exercise and microelectrode recordings of SNA to measure the reflex response. The distinctive features of this proposal include: (1) the use of state-of- the-art techniques (microelectrode recordings of SNA) to directly test mechanistic hypotheses in conscious humans; (2) assessment of mechanoreflex using a new paradigm which is developed in our laboratory which evokes sustained elevation in SNA and BP than other methods previously described in humans; and (3) the use of complimentary approach to asses central vs. peripheral effects of aldosterone on neural control of circulation during muscle contraction in the hypertensive rats.",26341655,0.535842489405029

2,"The host protein CPSF6 possesses a domain that can interact with the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein. CPSF6 has been implicated in regulating HIV-1 nuclear entry. However, its functional significance for HIV-1 replication has yet to be firmly established. Here we provide evidence for two divergent functions of CPSF6 for HIV-1 replication in vivo. We demonstrate that endogenous CPSF6 exerts an inhibitory effect on naturally occurring HIV-1 variants in individuals carrying the HLA-B27 allele. Conversely, we find a strong selective pressure in these individuals to preserve CPSF6 binding, while escaping from the restrictive activity by CPSF6. This active maintenance of CPSF6 binding during HIV-1 CA evolution in vivo contrasts with the in vitro viral evolution, which can reduce CPSF6 binding to evade from CPSF6-mediated restriction. Thus, these observations argue for a beneficial role of CPSF6 for HIV-1 in vivo. CPSF6-mediated restriction renders HIV-1 less dependent or independent from TNPO3, RanBP2 and Nup153, host factors implicated in HIV-1 nuclear entry. However, viral evolution that maintains CPSF6 binding in HLA-B27+ subjects invariably restores the ability to utilize these host factors, which may be the major selective pressure for CPSF6 binding in vivo. Our study uncovers two opposing CA-dependent functions of CPSF6 in HIV-1 replication in vivo; however, the benefit for binding CPSF6 appears to outweigh the cost, providing support for a vital function of CPSF6 during HIV-1 replication in vivo.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 infection depends on a series of molecular events involving biochemical interactions between viral components and host factors, resulting in fusion of viral and host membranes, reverse transcription, uncoating, nuclear entry, and integration. A key knowledge gap in the early stages of infection is the role of the viral capsid i facilitating reverse transcription. Mutations in the CA protein that destabilize the viral capsid result in impaired reverse transcription, indicating that the integrity of the viral capsid is critcal for efficient viral DNA synthesis. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is a low processivity enzyme and dissociates from the template during strand transfer steps of reverse transcription. Employing a biochemical approach involving purified HIV-1 cores, we will test the hypothesis that the viral capsid serves as a vessel to maintain the local concentration of RT during reverse transcription and will study the role of restrictive host factors in HIV-1 capsid recognition and uncoating. We will also identify novel host factors that bind the HIV-1 capsid. The work will be organized by the following Specific Aims: Aim 1.

4,"HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by type I interferon (IFN), and the expression of a number of gene products with anti-HIV-1 activity is induced by type I IFN. However, none of the known antiretroviral proteins can account for the ability of type I IFN to inhibit early, preintegration phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle in human cells. Here, by comparing gene expression profiles in cell lines that differ in their ability to support the inhibitory action of IFN-ÃÂ± at early steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle, we identify myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2) as an interferon-induced inhibitor of HIV-1 infection. Expression of MX2 reduces permissiveness to a variety of lentiviruses, whereas depletion of MX2 using RNA interference reduces the anti-HIV-1 potency of IFN-ÃÂ±. HIV-1 reverse transcription proceeds normally in MX2-expressing cells, but 2-long terminal repeat circular forms of HIV-1 DNA are less abundant, suggesting that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 nuclear import, or destabilizes nuclear HIV-1 DNA. Consistent with this notion, mutations in the HIV-1 capsid protein that are known, or suspected, to alter the nuclear import pathways used by HIV-1 confer resistance to MX2, whereas preventing cell division increases MX2 potency. Overall, these findings indicate that MX2 is an effector of the anti-HIV-1 activity of type-I IFN, and suggest that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection by inhibiting capsid-dependent nuclear import of subviral complexes.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1, the predominant cause of AIDS in humans, is unable to replicate in most non-human species. Therefore, the most practical animal model of human AIDS consists of infection of rhesus macaques with SIVMAC or chimeras derived from SIVMAC. However, the usefulness of these models is limited by the fact that HIV-1 and SIVMAC are distinct viruses. Based on an understanding of species-specific restriction factors, we have generated recombinant viruses, named simian tropic HIV (stHIV), that are almost entirely derived from HIV-1 but can replicate in pigtailed macaques. During the last funding cycle we have used animal adaptation to develop stHIV isolates that cause AIDS in pigtail macaques. Additionally, we have studied the effects of known restriction factors on stHIV replication and unveiled the activity of novel, as yet unidentified, inhibitors that are induced by IFN? and limit lentiviral replication in a species-specific manner in primary cells. The aims of this proposal are to further develop stHIV by generating infectious molecular clones that are consistently pathogenic following mucosal challenges in both pigtail and rhesus macaques and are based on HIV-1 strains circulating in humans. To achieve these aims our studies will include a more detailed characterization of restriction factor polymorphism and activity in macaques and how these drive virus evolution in animals. Additionally, we will identify novel IFN?-induced inhibitors that limit stHIV replication in macaque cells and generate stHIV variants that can overcome them. Our preliminary data suggest that these goals are feasible and will lead to the successful development of stHIV, an advance that has the potential to transform non- human primate models for HIV-1 drug and vaccine development.",24121441,0.13655011152709667

8,"Cancer-specific alterations in DNA methylation are hallmarks of human malignancies; however, the nature of the breast cancer epigenome and its effects on metastatic behavior remain obscure. To address this issue, we used genome-wide analysis to characterize the methylomes of breast cancers with diverse metastatic behavior. Groups of breast tumors were characterized by the presence or absence of coordinate hypermethylation at a large number of genes, demonstrating a breast CpG island methylator phenotype (B-CIMP). The B-CIMP provided a distinct epigenomic profile and was a strong determinant of metastatic potential. Specifically, the presence of the B-CIMP in tumors was associated with low metastatic risk and survival, and the absence of the B-CIMP was associated with high metastatic risk and death. B-CIMP loci were highly enriched for genes that make up the metastasis transcriptome. Methylation at B-CIMP genes accounted for much of the transcriptomal diversity between breast cancers of varying prognosis, indicating a fundamental epigenomic contribution to metastasis. Comparison of the loci affected by the B-CIMP with those affected by the hypermethylator phenotype in glioma and colon cancer revealed that the CIMP signature was shared by multiple human malignancies. Our data provide a unifying epigenomic framework linking breast cancers with varying outcome and transcriptomic changes underlying metastasis. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of breast cancer oncogenesis and aid the development of new prognostic biomarkers for this common malignancy.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Originally awarded in 1992, this application requests a five-year renewal of the T32 Head and Neck Training Program in Surgical Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).

11,"Active commuting to school (ACS; walking or cycling to school) appears promising for decreasing children's obesity risk, although long-term studies are sparse. The aim was to examine whether kindergarten ACS was associated with fifth-grade adiposity.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical activity decreases the risk of multiple cancers and is important for obesity prevention, which in turn is important for cancer prevention. Children's active commuting to school (ACS), previously common (42 percent in 1969-1970) is now uncommon (13 percent in 2009). This decline coincided with the obesity epidemic, which disproportionately affects low-income and ethnic minority children. Programs to increase children's moderate- to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and lower obesity risk are necessary. The walking school bus (WSB) is an innovative program in which children walk to and from school led by adults, who teach pedestrian safety. The WSB provides additional time for MVPA, and this team's pilot WSB study reported increases to children's ACS and MVPA in the short-term. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported on long-term (i.e. over one school year) efficacy of WSB programs on children's ACS, MVPA, pedestrian safety, and adiposity. Few studies have included children from disadvantaged socioeconomic or racial/ethnic backgrounds.  The Primary Goal is to conduct a cluster RCT to evaluate the long-term efficacy of a WSB program to increase low-income, ethnic minority children's ACS and MVPA. The investigators will take an interdisciplinary approach and use a social ecological model to consider multiple correlates of ACS and levels of analysis: (1) individual-level influences e.g. acculturation and constructs from social cognitive theory, (2) schools, and (3) macro-environmental influences e.g. neighborhood walkability and safety.  To achieve the project goals among 3-5th grade children, the Specific Aims include: SA1) To recruit 770 child-parent dyads from 22 elementary schools over 4 years and conduct a cluster RCT to  assess the efficacy of a WSB program on children's ACS, MVPA, and BMI z-score over a school-year SA2) To collect and analyze data on individual-, school-, and macro-level influences on changes to children's  ACS resulting from the WSB program  The Primary Hypotheses to be tested include: H1) The WSB program will increase children's ACS over a school-year.  H1a) Parents' outcome expectations and self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between the WSB  and changes to children's ACS.  H1b) Walkability, safety, and acculturation will moderate changes to children's ACS. H2) The WSB program will increase children's MVPA and decrease BMI z-scores over a school-year. H3) The WSB program will increase school-level pedestrian safety behaviors over a school-year. The proposed research will allow for optimal assessment of changes to children's ACS, test moderators and mediators of children's ACS, evaluate long term changes to MVPA and BMI z-score, and provide crucial planning information for a future community effectiveness trial.",24443901,0.3270460694066558
12,"High cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for atherosclerosis. Regression of atherosclerosis is mediated in part by the Liver X Receptor (LXR) through the induction of genes involved in cholesterol transport and efflux. In the context of diabetes, regression of atherosclerosis is impaired. We proposed that changes in glucose levels modulate LXR-dependent gene expression. Using a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured in normal or diabetes relevant high glucose conditions we found that high glucose inhibits the LXR-dependent expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), but not ABCG1. To probe for this mechanism, we surveyed the expression of a host of chromatin-modifying enzymes and found that Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) was reduced in high compared to normal glucose conditions. Importantly, ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux were reduced in Prmt2-/- compared to wild type BMDMs. Monocytes from diabetic mice also showed decreased expression of Prmt2 compared to non-diabetic counterparts. Thus, PRMT2 represents a glucose-sensitive factor that plays a role in LXR-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and lends insight to the presence of increased atherosclerosis in diabetic patients.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although it is well know that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) the reasons for this are not known. While these two forms of diabetes have some different risk factors, it is well established that several diabetes specific complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy are shared. We have studied factors that affect vascular disease primarily in models of insulin deficient diabetes and propose to study a factor common to all diabetics, hyperglycemia, and its effects on the bone marrow, circulating white blood cells, arterial macrophages, and atherosclerosis. Specifically, we will separate the effects of hyperglycemia from defective insulin actions and hyperlipidemia by inducing glucose reduction by inhibition of the renal sodium glucose cotransporter, SGLT2. We have shown that hyperglycemia increases blood monocyte and neutrophil levels, two know risk factors for CVD. In addition, we have reported that atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic mice have an increase in the number and inflammatory phenotype of their CD68+ cells after cholesterol reduction (regression). This application has three specific aims to define how hyperglycemia and DAMPs such as S100A8 affect the biology of circulating monocytes and neutrophils, and arterial macrophages. Aim 1 will study whether and how S100A8 and other DAMPs affect bone marrow and circulating myeloid cells. Specifically we have shown that S100A8 injection into mice increases monocyte and neurophil bone marrow precursors. We will determine whether the actions of S100A8 are additive to other effects of hyperglycemia and whether they function by interaction with RAGE or TLRs. Aim 2 will determine how models of type1 and type2 diabetes alter the number and inflammatory phenotype of circulating monocytes and neutrophils. The specific role of glucose in this process will be determined by assessing cells in diabetic glucose reduced mice. Aim 3 will study how diabetes ? hyperglycemia and S100A8 affect the number, emigration and phenotype of arterial CD68+ cells, as well as the recruitment of monocytes, during the progression and regression of atherosclerosis. These experiments aim to identify the major causes of increased CVD risk in both forms of diabetes and to identify new targets to prevent this complication and to allow normal regression of lesions in the setting of cholesterol reduction.",26288135,0.5161342690651801
13,"Adolescent obesity is predictive of future weight gain, obesity and adult onset severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¥40Ã¢ÂÂkgÃ¢ÂÂm(-2) ). Despite successful efforts to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing BMI, <5% of the 40-80% heritability of the phenotype has been explained. Identification of gene-gene (G-G) interactions between known variants can help explain this hidden heritability as well as identify potential biological mechanisms affecting weight gain during this critical developmental period.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to investigate how genetic variation influences weight-related traits during the transition from adolescence to adulthood - a critical risk period for weight gain. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >70 well-replicated loci influencing weight-related traits, some of which vary by race/ethnicity. Few studies have examined the genetic architecture of these traits during this critical period; the discovered loci are largely common variants that explain only a fraction of the estimated trait heritability. Fine-mapping studies suggest allelic heterogeneity; many causal variants remain to be determined. Recent attention has shifted to coding variants some of which may have larger effect sizes and potential to explain more trait heritability. We build on our successes in R01 HD057194 and capitalize on nationally representative, ethnically diverse, prospective and well-characterized data on 10,581 individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to assess the association between weight- related traits and coding variants across a 15-year lifecycle period of dramatic weight gain between adolescence and adulthood. In addition, to make full use of this excellent resource, we combine our data with extant exome data from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium (n>91,000) to further assess associations with adiposity phenotypes, an approach that will be particularly informative and powerful for the discovery of novel coding variants. Further, to fully ensure that we capitalize on the uniqueness of our longitudinal data on adolescent to adult weight gain, we combine our data with two well-characterized, age-matched cohorts with exome data (China Health and Nutrition Survey, CHNS n=1,951; Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, CLHNS, n=1,691) living under different environmental conditions but experiencing high levels of weight gain analogous to Add Health. Using all three datasets, we will determine the genetic and epidemiological architecture of causal variants; identify functional SNPs and genes; and using advanced and innovative statistical modeling, examine differential genetic effects by age, time, and under varying environmental circumstances to downstream cardiometabolic risk factors (diabetes-, blood pressure-, and inflammatory-related markers). We will test novel hypotheses on tempo and timing of risk as well as address each piece of the complex system linking genetic markers, weight-related outcomes, and cardiometabolic risk factors, in the context of a variety of environmental and behavioral confounders. In sum, these data provide outstanding resources for examining low frequency coding variants associated with weight- related and cardiometabolic traits - a rapidly emerging area of science. Our longitudinal and complex analyses in this understudied age range will provide critical information about risk in the transition from adolescence into adulthood, a period of rapid weight gain when precursors of adult disease are developing. Our work will shed light on the progression of risk to inform efforts to mitigate early development of disease risk.",25893265,0.3769802908711709
14,"Immunization of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice with fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) prevents Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. The first immunotherapy clinical trial used fibrillar Abeta, containing the B and T cell self epitopes of Abeta, as the immunogen formulated with QS21 as the adjuvant in the vaccine. Unfortunately, the clinical trial was halted during the phase II stage when 6% of the participants developed meningoencephalitis. The cause of the meningoencephalitis in the patients that received the vaccine has not been definitively determined; however, analysis of two case reports from the AN-1792 vaccine trial suggest that the meningoencephalitis may have been caused by a T cell-mediated autoimmune response, whereas production of anti-Abeta Abs may have been therapeutic to the AD patients. Therefore, to reduce the risk of an adverse T cell-mediated immune response to Abeta immunotherapy we have designed a prototype epitope vaccine that contains the immunodominant B cell epitope of Abeta in tandem with the synthetic universal Th cell pan HLA DR epitope, pan HLA DR-binding peptide (PADRE). Importantly, the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) sequence lacks the T cell epitope of Abeta. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) epitope vaccine produced high titers of anti-Abeta Abs. Splenocytes from immunized mice showed robust T cell stimulation in response to peptides containing PADRE. However, splenocytes from immunized mice were not reactivated by the Abeta peptide. New preclinical trials in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models may help to develop novel immunogen-adjuvant configurations with the potential to avoid the adverse events that occurred in the first clinical trial.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized clinically by progressive cognitive decline, eventually resulting in death, usually within 10 years of diagnosis. The neuropathological features of the disease include depositions of amyloid-? (A?), neurofibrillary tangles (tau), and neuronal loss in affected brain regions. Currently, the predominant theory of the etiology is delineated in the amyloid cascade hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the accumulations of various forms of soluble and/or insoluble A? have a central role in the onset and progression of AD and lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles. However, recent clinical studies using biomarkers demonstrated that A? abnormalities precede the tau pathology and cognitive decline by 10 years or more, whereas accumulation of pathological tau correlates with the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, there is a consensus in the field that A? - based immunotherapeutic(s) can be effective as a prophylactic measure in very early AD (prodromal) and/or in non-symptomatic subjects at risk for AD, while tau-based immunotherapeutic(s) can be used as a therapeutic measure in patients with mild-moderate AD. Accordingly, our team developed three recombinant protein- based epitope vaccines that target pathological A? (AV-1959R), tau (AV-1980R) or A? /tau (AV-1953R) simultaneously and tested the immunogenicity of these vaccines in wild-type mice. Of note, all these vaccines have been constructed on the proprietary universal MultiTEP platform (US patents submitted) that is highly immunogenic in mice, rabbits and monkeys. Based on these published results and preliminary data the goals of this competitive renewal project are to study the efficacy and safety of single and dual vaccines in 3xTg-AD mice that have both A? and tau pathologies. The following 3 aims will be pursued to achieve these goals: In Aim 1 we will test the efficacy of prophylactic vaccination initiated in young 3xTg-AD mice before the onset of AD-like pathology. More specifically, we will study the efficacy of epitope vaccines targeting either A? (AV- 1959R) or tau (AV-1980R) or A? /tau simultaneously (AV-1953R). In addition, we will optimize the vaccination regimen in these experiments. In Aim 2 we are planning to study the efficacy of a therapeutic/prophylactic vaccination regimen in 3xTg-AD mice with established A? -pathology but before the onset of tau pathology. The completion of these studies will allow us to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of AV-1959R, the prophylactic efficacy of AV-1980R, and therapeutic/prophylactic efficacies of AV-1953R vaccines. Again, in this aim we will optimize the therapeutic/prophylactic vaccination regimen. Finally, in Aim 3 we will study the efficacy of the therapeutic vaccination regimen in 3xTg-AD mice with established AD-like pathology at the start of vaccination. We believe that the completion of all three Aims by our stellar multidisciplinary team including immunologists, vaccine researchers, neuroscientists/cognitive scientists, and molecular biologists can help us to identify the best immunotherapeutic strategy and translate it to the clinic.",15661919,0.41110318908530086
15,"Understanding the mechanism by which ligands affect receptor conformational equilibria is key in accelerating membrane protein structural biology. In the case of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), we currently pursue a brute-force approach for identifying ligands that stabilize receptors and facilitate crystallogenesis.

This is now possible since our GPCR Structure Determination Pipeline (GSDP) and our newly developed GPCR Protein Fusion Toolchest has enabled large-scale structure determination of ligand-receptor complexes. The GSDP has been used by us in the successful structure determination of 14 different human GPCRs and their complexes, including two new receptors in activated states with bound agonist. In this proposed study, we will conduct similar efforts toward the crystallization and structural determination of ligand-receptor complexes of all of the receptors in the opioid family using agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists, and allosteric modulators.

The specific Aims are (i) Development of 3D structural models of opioid receptors complexes  with all known drugs and drug candidates, as well as systematic mapping of the ligand-receptor interactions  for determinants of selectivity to a specific opioid subtype or specific function (agonism, antagonism, biased  signaling); (ii) Virtual ligand screening of drug-like compounds against all opioid receptor subtypes in  different functional states for discovery of new opioid ligand chemotypes; (iii) Computer-assisted structure-  based design of lead compounds, including allosteric and bitopic ligands, for development new tool  compounds for opioid receptors with desired functional and pharmacologic profile.

This project will  combine molecular modeling with in vitro and in vivo experimental testing to decipher basic mechanisms of  opioid drug action on their receptors and suggest molecular ways to separate their pain and anxiety relief  effects from side effects.

Success of the program will not  only result in new insights into drug action and lead to new opioid ligands with desired properties as tool  compounds, but it will establish a platform for rational structure-based discovery of safer opioid therapies.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Development of new generation opioid medications with reduced risks of addiction, tolerance and other  unwanted side effects is of paramount importance for pain and anxiety relief therapies. This project will  combine molecular modeling with in vitro and in vivo experimental testing to decipher basic mechanisms of  opioid drug action on their receptors and suggest molecular ways to separate their pain and anxiety relief  effects from side effects. New knowledge will be applied to design of chemical compounds and peptides  with specific functional features for pain research and pave the path for new candidate therapies.",25937170,0.38229949185468676
23,"DREADDs are chemogenetic tools widely used to remotely control cellular signaling, neuronal activity, and behavior. Here we used a structure-based approach to develop a new Gi-coupled DREADD using the kappa-opioid receptor as a template (KORD) that is activated by the pharmacologically inert ligand salvinorin B (SALB). Activation of virally expressed KORD in several neuronal contexts robustly attenuated neuronal activity and modified behaviors. Additionally, co-expression of the KORD and the Gq-coupled M3-DREADD within the same neuronal population facilitated the sequential and bidirectional remote control of behavior. The availability of DREADDs activated by different ligands provides enhanced opportunities for investigating diverse physiological systems using multiplexed chemogenetic actuators.","Substances addressing the opioid system are widely used pharmaceuticals. Agonists (narcotic analgesics)  are used for the treatment of chronic pain, whereas antagonists are generally effective in the treatment of  addictive disorders, including substance abuse (opiate, alcohol, amphetamine) and non-substance, i.e.  behavioral addictions such as gaming, gambling and over-eating. The proposed program project will use  structural, biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to understand ligand binding  properties of all opioid receptors (p-, 6, K (MOR, DOR, KOR), and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide  receptor (NOP)) and to define the structural basis for molecular recognition and activation. The three overall  aims are (1): Understand opioid receptor molecular recognition and functional selectivity using X-ray  crystallography to determine structures of ligand-receptor complexes and NMR to understand dynamic  behavior. (2) Understand the molecular mechanisms for functional and pharmacological selectivity for the  four opioid receptors using computational approaches, and (3) Understand ligand-directed signaling (G-  protein-, arrestin-, JNK-dependent) and its relevance in mediating opioid receptor action. Management and  administration of the project will be carried out by the Management and Administration Core. Its main  responsibilities include (1) Overall management of all project to ensure progress, (2) Prioritization of studies,  (3) Assembly of a Scientific Advisory Board, (4) Preparation of required progress reports, (5) Establishment  and facilitation of communication routes within the POI as well as with external stakeholders (e.g. SAB, NIH),  and (6) Assurance ofthe high quality of studies and results.",25937170,0.6230216721036549

Given the difficulties associated with opioid agonist therapy, high risk of death due to overdose (more victims were reported in 2008, than overdose of heroin and cocaine combined) and the development of tolerance and addiction, there is a need for safer narcotic analgesics. The proposed research program uses structural, computational, biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches: (1) to develop a new level of understanding of the action the opioid receptors, | j , 6, K, and the nociceptin receptor, defining the structural basis for molecuar recognition and activation, and (2) to design new binding ligands. Aims are to (1) understand opioid receptor molecular recognition and functional selectivity using X-ray crystallography and NMR; (2) understand the molecular mechanisms for functional and pharmacological selectivity for the four receptors using computational approaches; and (3) understand ligand-directed signaling (G-protein-, arrestin-, JNK-dependent) and its relevance in mediating opioid receptor action. Three projects supported by four core groups via inter-project collaborations will address important but difficult questions at a scale not imagined prior to this year. Project 1 will carry ut structural determination on ligand bound complexes. Project 2 will carry out computational studies to define the binding pockets of opioid receptors and perform computer-assisted SBDD to design a new series of optimized compounds including allosteric, functionally selective and bitopic ligands. Project 3, will carry out in vitro and in vivo studies to characterize pharmacological properties of ligands and generate new receptor biased mutants to test hypotheses related to functional selectivity and opioid receptor actions. Core groups support the aims of all 3 projects and will be responsible for (1) large-scale production of purified opioid receptors; (2) synthesis of opiate ligands including newly designed tool compounds for structural and functional studies; (3) molecular profiling and screening of new small molecules, and (4) management and administration of the overall program.

25,"Two studies examined the relationship between maternal attitudes and symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. In the first study, a measure of maternal attitudes, the Attitudes Toward Motherhood Scale (AToM), was developed and validated in a sample of first-time mothers. The AToM was found to have good internal reliability and convergent validity with cognitive biases and an existing measure of maternal attitudes. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses determined that the measure comprises three correlated factors: beliefs about others' judgments, beliefs about maternal responsibility, and maternal role idealization. In the second study, we used the AToM to assess the relationship between maternal attitudes and other psychological variables. The factor structure of the measure was confirmed. Maternal attitudes predicted symptoms of depression and anxiety, and these attitudes had incremental predictive validity over general cognitive biases and interpersonal risk factors. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that maternal attitudes are related to psychological distress among first-time mothers during the transition to parenthood and may provide a useful means of identifying women who may benefit from intervention during the perinatal period.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that childhood adversity is one of the most potent predictors of adult affective disorders, particularly among women. Further, an important dissociation has been reported for a subgroup of women who experience early life adversity but do not present with adult disease, suggesting that there may be resiliency factors important in disease protection or amelioration. In fact, the availability of a caring and stable parent or guardian has been shown to be one of the most important aspects that distinguish between positive and negative outcomes in abused individuals. We propose that one vital contributor to the increased risk for major depressive disorder (MOD) in women, and propensity for other affective disturbances at specific reproductive time points, is the programming effect of prepubertal adversity on dysregulation of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) activity and ovarian steroid responsiveness across the lifespan. It is well documented that from puberty to the late perimenopause, MOD and several anxiety disorders are more common in females than males. Moreover, periods of hormonal flux across the female lifespan are associated with increased risk for affective disturbance: the premenstrum (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), the postpartum (onset/relapse bipolar disorder, MOD), and the perimenopause (depression symptoms and MDD. The goal of the scientific Projects in this SCOR proposal is to determine how the experience of prepubertal adversity reprograms the brain toward stress dysregulation, and how this intersects with periods of dynamic hormonal flux across the life span, including pregnancy (Projects I & III) and aging (Projects II & III). In addition, mechanistic epigenetic studies will examine sex differences in response to stress during this sensitive window of brain maturation (Project III). SCOR funding would harness the respective expertise of Drs. Epperson and Bale in behavioral and molecular models of stress and reproductive neuroendocrinology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging, to create the Penn Center for the Study of Sex and Gender in Behavioral Health.

Consistent with the overarching  theme of this SCOR application, we propose that prepubertal adversity contributes not only to the sex bias  for affective disorders in women, but their heightened risk for these disturbances during periods of dynamic  hormonal change. Prepubertal stress certainly contributes to adverse outcomes in men, as well as women.  However, menopausal women provide the ideal population for the investigation of eariy life adversity effects  on the estrogen-serotonin interaction as it relates to affect and cognition. Preclinical and human studies  highlight the lasting impact of prepubertal adversity on serotonin function at the gene, enzyme,  neurotransmitter, and receptor levels. Pertinent to menopausal women, stress and estradiol (E2) share  many of the same serotonergic targets with early and chronic adversity leading to sub-optimal serotonergic  response to E2. Could stress modify the estrogen x serotonin relationship and be responsible for suboptimal  affect regulation and cognition during periods of dwindling estrogen? Our hypotheses are explored through  an observational evaluation of women over the menopausal transition. We will select a subgroup of these  women in early postmenopause, with and without significant childhood adversity, who will undergo  experimentally-induced serotonin reduction with the tryptophan depletion paradigm and fMRI pre and post  short-term E2 treatment. We will investigate the impact of prepubertal adversity and these experimental  manipulations on brain activation during performance of affective processing and working memory tasks.  Additionally, we will examine adversity effects on basal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal HPA axis function  using the Cortisol awaking response and relate these data to our main outcomes of interest.

Pregnancy is also a unique period in a woman's endocrine life  when sex steroids are at 10- to 100- fold their nonpregnancy levels and stress hormones are surging. In  fact, at no other time in human life are both corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and Cortisol persistently  elevated as the placental production of CRF is positively driven by maternal and fetal Cortisol production.  Project I serves as the initial segment of the lifespan approach to understanding the effects of prepubertal  adversity on brain function as it relates to risk for affective disorders (depression and anxiety) in women. In  this project we evaluate a two-generational model of stress by examining the effect of maternal prepubertal  adversity on the progeny's health as a way to understand the earliest environmental influence on the biologic  development of their offspring. We hypothesize that the effects of maternal past and present experience can  be 'transmitted' to the fetus via the exceptional hormonal milieu of the intrauterine environment, programming  the offspring's own response to future life events through HPA axis dysregulation.

It is well documented that from puberty to the late perimenopause, MOD and several anxiety disorders are more common in females than males. Moreover, periods of hormonal flux across the female lifespan are associated with increased risk for affective disturbance: the premenstrum (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), the postpartum (onset/relapse bipolar disorder, MOD), and the perimenopause (depression symptoms and MDD. The goal of the scientific Projects in this SCOR proposal is to determine how the experience of prepubertal adversity reprograms the brain toward stress dysregulation, and how this intersects with periods of dynamic hormonal flux across the life span, including pregnancy (Projects I & III) and aging (Projects II & III). In addition, mechanistic epigenetic studies will examine sex differences in response to stress during this sensitive window of brain maturation (Project III). SCOR funding would harness the respective expertise of Drs. Epperson and Bale in behavioral and molecular models of stress and reproductive neuroendocrinology, psychophysiology, and neuroimaging, to create the Penn Center for the Study of Sex and Gender in Behavioral Health. The Center would provide an intellectual platform with important resources to encourage established investigators, and their mentees, to consider sex and gender as crucial factors in their research.",23238908,0.2212238747643559
38,"Midlife decline in cognition, specifically in areas of executive functioning, is a frequent concern for which menopausal women seek clinical intervention. The dependence of executive processes on prefrontal cortex function suggests estrogen effects on this brain region may be key in identifying the sources of this decline. Recent evidence from rodent, nonhuman primate, and human subject studies indicates the importance of considering interactions of estrogen with neurotransmitter systems, stress, genotype, and individual life events when determining the cognitive effects of menopause and estrogen therapy.","Project II focuses on the menopause as a critical window in the hormonal life of women, a period of  increased risk for new onset affective disorders and cognitive complaints. Consistent with the overarching  theme of this SCOR application, we propose that prepubertal adversity contributes not only to the sex bias  for affective disorders in women, but their heightened risk for these disturbances during periods of dynamic  hormonal change. Prepubertal stress certainly contributes to adverse outcomes in men, as well as women.  However, menopausal women provide the ideal population for the investigation of eariy life adversity effects  on the estrogen-serotonin interaction as it relates to affect and cognition. Preclinical and human studies  highlight the lasting impact of prepubertal adversity on serotonin function at the gene, enzyme,  neurotransmitter, and receptor levels. Pertinent to menopausal women, stress and estradiol (E2) share  many of the same serotonergic targets with early and chronic adversity leading to sub-optimal serotonergic  response to E2. Could stress modify the estrogen x serotonin relationship and be responsible for suboptimal  affect regulation and cognition during periods of dwindling estrogen? Our hypotheses are explored through  an observational evaluation of women over the menopausal transition. We will select a subgroup of these  women in early postmenopause, with and without significant childhood adversity, who will undergo  experimentally-induced serotonin reduction with the tryptophan depletion paradigm and fMRI pre and post  short-term E2 treatment. We will investigate the impact of prepubertal adversity and these experimental  manipulations on brain activation during performance of affective processing and working memory tasks.  Additionally, we will examine adversity effects on basal hypothalamic pituitary adrenal HPA axis function  using the Cortisol awaking response and relate these data to our main outcomes of interest. Like Project I,  Project II utilizes the Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) Questionnaire to consider prepubertal adversity not  from the standpoint of one particular kind of stressor or trauma, but from a more holistic appreciation of early  life 'adversity' as a potent predictor of HPA axis dysregulation and disease risk.",23238908,0.4610070540162689

Pregnancy is also a unique period in a woman's endocrine life  when sex steroids are at 10- to 100- fold their nonpregnancy levels and stress hormones are surging. In  fact, at no other time in human life are both corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and Cortisol persistently  elevated as the placental production of CRF is positively driven by maternal and fetal Cortisol production.  Project I serves as the initial segment of the lifespan approach to understanding the effects of prepubertal  adversity on brain function as it relates to risk for affective disorders (depression and anxiety) in women. In  this project we evaluate a two-generational model of stress by examining the effect of maternal prepubertal  adversity on the progeny's health as a way to understand the earliest environmental influence on the biologic  development of their offspring. We hypothesize that the effects of maternal past and present experience can  be 'transmitted' to the fetus via the exceptional hormonal milieu of the intrauterine environment, programming  the offspring's own response to future life events through HPA axis dysregulation. We propose that female  infants will be more susceptible to fetal programming than male infants as one explanatory factor for  increased prevalence of depression in females compared to males. This project examines maternal and  infant HPA axis function and utilizes the well-tolerated acoustic startle paradigm to explore the potential link  beh/veen maternal prepubertal adversity and the following outcomes; 1) maternal HPA axis responsivity; 2)  maternal psychophysiology, at baseline and in response to affect modulation; 3) infant behavioral and HPA  axis response to stress; and 4) sex difference in infant outcomes. In addition, this project will serve as the  basis for future exploration of the potential interaction between prepubertal adversity and serotonin and  stress system genes in the sex bias for MDD and other disorders for which sex differences have been noted.",23238908,0.4837799611111869

The most common underlying feature in affective disorders is that of stress dysregulation. The goal  of this proposal is to determine how the prepubertal adversity experience reprograms the brain toward stress  dysregulation, or stress resilience, and how this is influenced during dynamic hormonal changes across the  female life span, including pregnancy and aging. We are proposing to examine similar outcome measures  proposed in the human subject studies in Projects I & II in a mouse model. The mouse model allows greater  control over manipulations in the environment and dissection of potential mechanisms involved in  programming of endpoints than what is possible in humans, and thus is an invaluable model for this SCOR  proposal. Aims for these studies include: 1) To examine the programming effects of prepubertal adversity on  adult stress responsivity during the period of dynamic hormonal change, pregnancy, in a mouse model.  Behavioral and physiological analyses during this period will include assessment of the HPA stress axis, and  anxiety-like behaviors as well as stress responsivity in both male and female offspring; 2) To examine the  programming effects of prepubertal adversity on adult stress responsivity during the period of dynamic  hormonal change, aging, in a mouse model. Sex differences in behavioral and physiological analyses in  aged mice will include assessment of the HPA stress axis, cognitive flexibility and performance, and anxiety-  like behaviors; and 3) To examine the potential molecular mechanisms by which prepubertal adversity may  program changes in stress pathway maturation and thus altering long-term adult stress responses during  dynamic hormonal periods, including examination of the sex-specific brain miRNA environment and  epigenetic histone marks in relevant brain regions during the prepubertal window.",23238908,0.4225505230882147

In the current study, we focused on the 986 samples with spa type t008 from the same population.","Introduction: With increasing availability of pathogen genetic and especially whole-genome sequence data,  there is a pressing need for analytical tools and innovative approaches to make use of them. In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",26873713,

97,"Understanding how our use of antimicrobial drugs shapes future levels of drug resistance is crucial. Recently, there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e., high dose) or more moderate (i.e., lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population.","Introduction: With increasing availability of pathogen genetic and especially whole-genome sequence data,  there is a pressing need for analytical tools and innovative approaches to make use of them.

In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",26278132,

We  will write one or more papers summarizing the findings from each symposia, so that the outputs will be  available to those who do not attend. We will also video record these symposia for web viewing. In addition,  we plan two very different projects motivated by issues that have arisen during the current grant period. First,  we will write a philosophical paper on the broad question of how models can be used to motivate decisions,  focused on how the assumptions of the model can be designed to be conservative with respect to the  decision being made.

142,"Estimating the case-fatality risk (CFR)-the probability that a person dies from an infection given that they are a case-is a high priority in epidemiologic investigation of newly emerging infectious diseases and sometimes in new outbreaks of known infectious diseases. The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing.

In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",26181387,

160,We conducted a matched case-control study of 566 HIV-infected children in Botswana during a 2009-2010 measles outbreak to identify the risk factors for measles. Children in the oldest age quartile (Ã¢ÂÂ¥13.1 years) were 4-fold more likely to acquire measles than those in the youngest quartile (<7.1 years). HIV-infected older children and adolescents may benefit from additional measles vaccination.,"Introduction: With increasing availability of pathogen genetic and especially whole-genome sequence data,  there is a pressing need for analytical tools and innovative approaches to make use of them. In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",26121202,

For current public health crises and emerging epidemics, statistical analysis of  biomedical data typically requires an initial exploratory stage where one looks for potential trends and  associations visually before carrying out rigorous hypothesis testing.

The insights gained during data  exploration, as well as the patterns missed due to shortcomings in the visualization, might set specific  directions, for better or worse, during later model building or decision-making.

The structure  of our entire proposal reflects the view that transmission-dynamic models are tools that interpret raw data to  produce evidence that can be used to make informed decisions (information flow upward in Figure P-1, taken  from our policy summary ofthe experience with H1N1 pandemic influenza). The MIDAS network has  spearheaded progress in improving the size, speed, and level of detail of transmission-dynamic models and  other models for infectious diseases. While we will continue to press forward on that front, many of the other  activities proposed for CCDD are motivated by the relative lack of attention to date to rigorous research on how  model structure and parameter values should be informed by data, and in particular by new sources of data  like genomics and participatory surveillance that will become increasingly available in the future. In this Policy  Studies section, we propose first a series of symposia that will focus on particular aspects of the modeling  process, especially the upstream (data->model structure and parameters) aspects, and we will invite decision  makers to these symposia and involve them as much as possible in the presentations and discussions. We  will write one or more papers summarizing the findings from each symposia, so that the outputs will be  available to those who do not attend. We will also video record these symposia for web viewing. In addition,  we plan two very different projects motivated by issues that have arisen during the current grant period. First,  we will write a philosophical paper on the broad question of how models can be used to motivate decisions,  focused on how the assumptions of the model can be designed to be conservative with respect to the  decision being made.

In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",26075402,

In particular,  methods for using genomic data to make inferences about transmission chains and pathogen evolution under  selection by host immunity, vaccines, and antibiotics, are still in their infancy. These questions are  fundamentally different from the types of questions asked when examining one sequence at a time, which  illuminate the biology of conserved aspects of infection and pathogenesis. Population genomic studies shed  light on population heterogeneity in the pathogen, its consequences and causes. These inferences naturally  lend themselves to the estimation of parameters for transmission-dynamic models and, even more  fundamentally, to the determination of how such models should be structured, and the testing of their  predictions. To date, using MIDAS and non-MIDAS funding for analytic efforts, and non-MIDAS funding for the  costs of sequencing, we have made a number of significant discoveries over the last five years using pathogen  population genomics and genetics, and we have identified many opportunities to improve and expand methods  over the next five years, as well as to apply existing methods to significant questions of biology and  epidemiology.",25983013,

Program  members have broad expertise in the biology of tumor viruses, including EBV, KSHV, alpha and beta  herpesvirus, HPV, HCV, HIV and other retroviruses, as well as emerging viral agents including Merkel cell  polyoma viruses and other recently identified gamma-herpesviruses. The Program facilitates research in  thematic areas through highly interactive and productive affinity groups in Viral Oncogenesis, DNA Virology,  and Viral Receptors and Retrovirology. Since 2002, the Program has been led by Erle Robertson, PhD; in  2012, David Weiner, PhD, a pioneer in translational medicine and vaccine development, became Program Co-  Leader. Both Co-Leaders are experienced, well-funded and highly collaborative in their leadership and  research activities. During the project period, important strides have been made to further develop the  Program, which include fostering a stronger focus on translational research, developing new intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborative efforts, recruiting additional tumor virologists, and better member engagement  through Program meetings as well as interdisciplinary, inter-Programmatic retreats. In doing so, the Tumor  Virology Program has nucleated interest among basic and clinical investigators in studying the roles of viruses  in cancer with collaborating members from the Tumor Biology, Immunobiology, Cancer Control, Cancer  Therapeutics, and Radiobiology and Imaging Programs. The major aims of the Program are to: 1) Understand  the mechanisms mediating cellular transformation, immortalization and cell cycle dysregulation by viral  encoded proteins; 2) Understand the viral-receptor interactions and the structure/function of viral receptors; 3)  Understand the molecular biology and pathogenesis of retroviruses as they relate to AIDS and AIDS-related  malignancies; 4) Develop viral vectors for human cancer gene therapy; and 5) Develop vaccine strategies for  treatment of viral-associated cancers. The Tumor Virology Program consists of 22 members from five  departments and two schools. Two new members have been added to the Program in the last five years,  increasing its breadth and strength. Program members have $10.2M in cancer-related grant funding (annual  direct costs), of which $6.9M is peer-reviewed and positioned to support cancer-related studies. $1.8M is  directly NCI-funded. During the project period, members published 176 cancer-related papers, of which 10%  were intra-Programmatic, 13% were inter-Programmatic and 51% were multi-institutional.",26453799,

The Program is currently led by Angela DeMichele, MD,  MSCE, an expert in clinical trials and translational biomarker research who has served as a Co-Leader since  2005, and Roger Greenberg, MD, PhD, who has a complementary background in breast cancer biology  (focusing on BRCA-dependent DNA repair) and genetic susceptibility. Dr. Greenberg recently replaced Dr.  Chodosh, the ACC's AD for Basic Research, who continues to be an active member. Members of the Program  are focused on understanding the underlying causes of breast cancer to improve the detection, prevention, and  treatment of this disease. They work together to achieve this goal by focusing on four key scientific areas: 1)  Elucidation of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer development and progression; 2)  Improvements in genetic risk assessment and development of novel prevention strategies; 3) Development of  innovative imaging approaches to improve breast cancer detection and the assessment of therapeutic  response; and 4) Translation of laboratory discoveries to novel therapeutics and biomarkers of response and  outcome. Members are highly interactive, as reflected in their leadership of multiple collaborative grants,  including an NCI U01, an NCI U54, a Department of Defense (DOD) Breast Cancer Center of Excellence, a  DOD Idea Award, the Basser Center for BRCA, the 2-PREVENT Breast Cancer Translational Center of  Excellence and numerous interdisciplinary translational clinical trials. In addition to facilitating intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborations, Program Leadership has emphasized breast cancer translational research as a  major focus, implementing a breast cancer biospecimen bank and database, recruiting external faculty with  important new expertise to the Program, and holding or participating in major ACC retreats that emphasize  breast cancer research. The ACC's investment in clinical research, particularly the interdisciplinary Rena  Rowan Breast Center, has facilitated patient-oriented research. The Program consists of 19 members from  eight departments in the Perelman School of Medicine and the School of Arts and Sciences. These members  have $9M in cancer-related grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $7.5M is peer-reviewed and $4.6M is  NCI-funded.

This Core was rated ?Exceptional? in the last renewal. The Core provides expert biostatistical guidance in the design, conduct, and analysis of research projects conducted by cancer center members, and offers training in the fundamentals of design and analysis to the Penn cancer research community. Core personnel are prepared not only to apply existing methods of design and analysis, but also to modify or develop new methods to address novel design and analysis issues arising in cancer research projects. A major responsibility is to support the design of clinical trials; as such, the Biostatistics Core plays a key role in the Protocol Review and Monitoring System, particularly through the Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee. Access to the Core is limited to ACC members. Andrea Troxel, ScD, Professor of Biostatistics, has served as a Core member since 2004 and as Director of the Biostatistics Core since 2014; she leads an accomplished and highly collaborative team drawn from the faculty of the Penn Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. During the current project period, the Biostatistics Core has continued to be a dynamic presence in the ACC, providing collaborative biostatistical support services across the spectrum of cancer research. Participation of the Core has been essential to the funding of numerous currently funded grants, including three P01s, three P50s (including two SPOREs), one P60, one P42, two U01s, and one U54 in areas such as skin cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate and testicular cancer, thoracic cancers, esophageal cancer, smoking cessation research, and environmental carcinogenesis, as well as 25 R01s, six R21s, several K-series grants, and numerous foundation and state government grants. During the current project period, the Core has added strength in statistical methods for genetic data, clinical prediction, and pediatric oncology. Core members have co-authored roughly 400 publications in the current project period. In the upcoming grant cycle, the Core will assume responsibility for data management in the ACC, subsuming the role of the Biomedical Data Coordination Core. In summary, the Biostatistics Core is composed of a superbly qualified, productive, versatile and highly collaborative team of biostatistics and data management professionals who are deeply involved in supporting research throughout the ACC. 78 ACC members have used the Core in the reporting period of 10/01/13-09/31/14, and ACC member usage constitutes 100% of the total Core usage. CCSG support represents 21% of the proposed Core budget, with the remainder coming from other research grants and Institutional funds.",26453799,

The  Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the rapid development of novel research ideas which are  translatable to the clinical arena and ideally can be individualized to disease and patient-specific settings. The  Programmatic goals are as follows: 1) Bring forward novel preclinical breakthroughs from the bench to the  bedside and bring relevant cancer therapeutics from the clinic to the lab in order to enhance the mechanistic  understanding of cancer therapeutics; 2) Take new drugs from first-in-human Phase I trials to disease-specific  clinical trials that will have a significant impact on establishing new standards of care; and 3) Develop  pharmacodynamic and predictive markers to select the best drugs for the patients most likely to respond.  These goals are applied across four research themes: targeted therapies, combinations to overcome  resistance, immunotherapy, and predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. This Program, which was rated  as ?Excellent? at the time of the prior CCSG renewal application, is led by Program Co-Leaders Drs. Ravi  Amaravadi and Naomi Haas, who were jointly appointed in September 2013. They succeed Drs. Peter  O'Dwyer and Corey Langer, who were asked to become leaders of new cross-Programmatic translational  research Initiatives in pancreatic and lung cancer, respectively. The new Co-Leaders were chosen because  they have complementary skill sets that match the future directions of the Program. Dr. Amaravadi has  expertise in the preclinical-to-translational space, and Dr. Haas has expertise in taking Phase I studies into  disease-specific studies and developing multi-institution clinical trials. Drs. Amaravadi and Haas are NCI-  funded researchers who bring their scientific vision, innovativeness and energy to this Program, which includes  an emphasis on basic and translational research. The 25 Program members represent 10 departments in the  Perelman School of Medicine. During the current project period, translational research has continued to be a  major focus. Members currently have $6.7M in annual research grant funding (direct costs), of which $3.6M is  peer-reviewed and $2.4M is NCI-funded.

The Program has two scientific aims. They are to: 1) Develop a  mechanisms-based understanding of the genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes regulating normal and  malignant hematopoiesis, and 2) Translate basic scientific discoveries into more effective and manageable  therapies. Thematic areas include transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic regulation of normal and  malignant hematopoietic cells; signal transduction in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells; molecular  therapeutics; hematopoietic stem cell biology and transplantation; and immune-based therapies. Program  members are extensive users of CCSG-supported resources (e.g., Clinical Protocol and Data Management,  Biostatistics Core, Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility, and  Human Immunology Core) and have extensive collaborations with other Abramson Cancer Center Programs  including Cancer Control, Cancer Therapeutics, Immunobiology, Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies,  Radiobiology and Imaging, and Pediatric Oncology. The Program is Co-Led by Dr. Edward Stadtmauer, an  expert in clinical trials of novel therapeutics for hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplantation,  and Dr. Nancy Speck, an internationally known basic scientist working in the area of hematopoietic stem cells  and leukemia. The Program's 21 members come from five departments (Medicine, Pediatrics, Genetics,  Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Cell and Developmental Biology) in the Perelman School of Medicine.  An innovative Hematologic Malignancies Translational Center of Excellence co-led by Dr. Stadtmauer has  catalyzed an already successful Program by adding laboratory, tissue banking, and clinical research personnel  resources as well as pilot grant funding. Prominent examples of Program advances include the demonstration  by Dr. Blobel that the formation of chromatin loops directly activates transcription of globin genes, the  demonstration by Dr. Tong that interaction of the cytokine signaling regulator Lnk with JAK2 is regulated by the  14-3-3 proteins, the reduction of graft versus host disease by CCR5 blockade, reported by a new member, Dr.  Reshef and colleagues, and the application of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) modified T-cell therapy for  CLL and B-cell ALL, led by Dr. Porter. Weekly seminars, collaborative grant submissions, weekly clinical  working group meetings, and an annual research retreat organized by Drs. Speck and Stadtmauer facilitate  member interactions.

Tapan Ganguly, PhD, the Director of the DNA Sequencing Facility since 2003, has been appointed Director of the consolidated Core. The integration of the two Shared Resources provides more efficient access and clarity of technologies to Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) members. It also presents opportunities for enhancing the quality and the range of services with better coordination as well as maximizing resource utilization without duplication. A team of highly experienced and trained professionals under two Technical Directors provides a whole spectrum of genomic and molecular biological services. These services are essential to ACC members for studying the role of specific genes in normal or abnormal cellular processes found in cancer cells and tumors. Investigators are able to observe global gene expression pattern in a sample, and genetic variability in an unaffected or tumor genome. The Core offers sequencing service on two platforms, gold standard Sanger sequencing on ABI capillary sequencers, and semiconductor sequencing on Ion Torrent PGM and its upgrade, Proton. The capillary sequencers also enable microsatellite genotyping and fragment analysis. Whole genome and targeted molecular profiling are performed on multiple platforms. The Core supports quantitative RNA profiling on Affymetrix GeneChips, Luminex FlexMap 3D, Fluidigm BioMark HD, and ABI 7900 real-time PCR system while DNA profiling is available on Affymetrix SNP GeneChip, Fluidigm BioMark HD and ABI 7900. The molecular biological services include cloning, subcloning and targeting vector construction for gene targeting in mice. ACC members benefit from consultations and training available throughout their projects. The range of services along with the expertise of the Core Director facilitates gene discovery, functional characterization and other research questions to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human cancers. In addition, molecular profiling of DNA and RNA together with targeted sequencing of cancer genes can help ACC members in cancer diagnosis, subclassifications, risk prediction and selection of appropriate therapy. 117 ACC members used the Core in the reporting period (10/01/13- 09/30/14) representing 36% of the total Core usage.

It provides the organizational structure and research forum for the  efficient conduct of collaborative basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research in melanoma, basal and squamous  cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lynn Schuchter, MD has been Program Leader since 2007,  after being an active member since 1989. John Seykora, MD, PhD was appointed Co-Leader in 2014 given the  expansion of the Program into non-melanoma skin cancers. Members have a high degree of collaboration with  other Research Programs and extramural investigators. The primary goal of the Program is to improve survival  and quality of life for patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers and CTCL through basic,  translational, and clinical epidemiological research. Three highly translational thematic areas of scientific focus  include: epidemiology and risk assessment; the biology of cutaneous malignancies; and experimental  therapeutics, including both targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches. The cohesiveness of the Program is  maintained through several collaborative mechanisms (monthly research meetings, weekly tumor boards,  monthly research in progress meetings, a yearly retreat sponsored by the Cancer Center) and NCI-funded  multi-investigator research grants. The Program's 26 members are drawn from 11 departments from Penn's  Perelman School of Medicine and two departments from The Wistar Institute. Critically important resources  have been developed by Program members, and are supported by the Cancer Center, which have fostered the  highly productive, translational research that distinguishes this Program. The resources include a  comprehensive melanoma database; a melanoma pathology archive, from which investigators can access  annotated pathology slides and blocks (normal skin and lesions) of patients seen as far back as 30 years ago;  and a large biorepository of thousands of collected blood and tumor samples from patients with cutaneous  lymphoma. During the project period, the Program has been remarkably productive with numerous  investigator-initiated clinical trials and publications in high impact journals including New England Journal of  Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cell, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. The success of these efforts  is reflected in the award of an NCI Skin Cancer SPORE and additional grants in laboratory-based translational  and population science research, including two NCI P01 grants to support innovative clinical/translational  research. In total, members have $4.1M in research funding (annual direct costs) of which $2.3M is peer-  reviewed and $1.5 is from the NCI.

This Program, which was  founded in the early 1970s, continues to progressively respond to advances in cancer research. Its overarching  scientific aims are to: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of carcinogenesis, and 2) Translate these  findings into durable clinical applications. To that end, the Program is organized around three central goals or  themes: 1) Structural biology of molecules relevant to cancer, 2) The molecular and cellular basis of cancer,  and 3) The use of model organisms to study cancer in vivo. Interactive, intra-Programmatic scientific affinity  groups foster collaboration within and across themes, including: 1) Tthe tumor microenvironment, 2) RNA  biology, 3) DNA repair and genomic stability, 4) Cancer cell metabolism (this spawned a new ACC Basic  Science Center of Excellence), and 5) Organ-specific cancers, such as pancreatic (this has been integrated  into the new ACC Pancreatic Translational Center of Excellence). The Program continues under the strong  leadership of Anil Rustgi, MD, who fosters deep and impactful intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborative  relationships. Program Leadership is also instrumental in recruiting new members (e.g., Drs. Berger, Feldser,  Garcia, and PurÃ©), mentoring junior faculty, establishing scientific affinity groups to leverage and further  develop common research interests among faculty members, and organizing conferences and symposia.  Program members are extremely actively involved in the training and mentorship of PhD students, MD/PhD  students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows by virtue of their leadership roles in the Penn Biomedical  Graduate Studies, MD/PhD (MSTP) program and NIH T32 training grants. Program Leadership was highly  successful in harnessing Institutional support to catalyze a tumor biology translational research initiative and  increased translational research has been pursued in both thematic and organ-specific contexts. Its success is  evident in the emergence of new transdisciplinary, disease-specific collaborations that join Program members  with colleagues in Clinical Research and Population Science to study cancers, such as pancreatic and  esophageal, in which there is an unmet need for improved diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the Program  has 50 members from 16 departments and four different schools with total funding of $22M (annual direct  costs) of which $18.7M is peer-reviewed and $5.6M is NCI-funded. Since 2010, members published 466  cancer-related papers, of which 15% were intra-Programmatic, 32% were inter-Programmatic, and 30% were  multi-institutional.",26453799,

Bruce Levine, PhD, Barbara and Edward Netter Professor in Cancer Gene Therapy, has overseen the Facility since its inception, initially as a pilot Facility and then a developing Facility in 1999. The mission of the Facility is to facilitate translation of bench-to-bedside research in novel allogeneic and autologous cell-based vaccines and experimental gene therapies. The Facility performs cell and biologic processing and expansion on a range of different cell types, including peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood derived CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, monocyte derived dendritic cells, and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in support of first-in-human and early Phase I and II cell and gene therapy clinical trials, with an emphasis on cancer. The Facility provides a range of services to ACC investigators to support preclinical process development and validation experiments for successful Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) clinical translation, clinical trial manufacturing, and specified testing for cell and gene therapy products for human administration. Notable accomplishments facilitated by the Facility have been first-in-human trials, including the first use of a lentiviral vector, the first infusions of zinc finger nuclease genome-modified cells, and the first use of lentivirally-modified cells to treat cancer. In 2005, with a considerable investment of non-Core Grant Funds from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Abramson Cancer Center and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, this facility expanded into a newly renovated 10-room GMP suite within the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). In 2013, demonstrating continued and significantly increasing investigator usage of the Facility the Facility opened a second 10-room GMP suite in HUP (with additional investment of non-Core funds), effectively doubling capacity. These facilities are the only spaces on campus that can perform cell and tissue processing in compliance with FDA regulations 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. Since 1999, Dr. Levine and the Facility have supported >30 FDA Investigational New Drug Applications at Penn and external institutions and produced over 2000 cellular vaccines that have been safely administered to more than 700 patients. The Facility currently supports manufacturing for 18 investigational new drug applications (INDs). The quality and the quantity of projects and clinical products generated in the Facility are recognized among collaborating institutions and pharmaceutical partners. In the reporting period (10/01/13-09/30/14), 19 investigators used the Facility, of which ACC member usage represents 58%.

The CPDM, in  collaboration with ACC Leadership, creates, directs and enforces the operational standards (policies) and  expectations for the conduct of all clinical research within the ACC. The CPDM scope is of necessity broad,  encompassing development and updating of policies and procedures, education and training, supervision of  data managers and research nurses, and oversight over all of the specialty clinical research units within our  Center. The CPDM manages our centralized Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS), Velos, organizes  and performs quality assurance and QC/monitoring of clinical trials across the center, and directly manages the  complex, ongoing and recurring activities of our mandatory clinical research review committees. Key units  supported by the CPDM are the Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM), the Protocol Review and  Monitoring System (PRMS, known as the Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee  [CTSRMC]), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  While CPDM provides the administrative support for PRMS and DSMC, it is vital to note that these are, by  design, distinct entities. PRMS is described elsewhere in this renewal. The inclusion of Women and  Minorities in clinical trials is a central focus of ACC Leadership and clinical investigators as a component of  our commitment to addressing the cancer burden in minority and underserved populations. During the current  award period, the ACC implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in cancer incidence and  mortality in minorities, including completion of quality improvement training to further increase the diversity of  the patients on cancer clinical trials at ACC, establishment of additional key partnerships with community  organizations to increase educational efforts and community outreach, creation of cancer screening navigation  programs that increase patient engagement and improve access to and completion of cancer screening tests,  and recruitment of a cadre of patient navigators for common diseases in our catchment area affecting  minorities, including lung, colorectal and breast cancer, in order to assist patients from all backgrounds in  getting into our health care system and using it effectively. Children with cancer have traditionally had a very  high participation rate in clinical research studies with the field of pediatric oncology often at the forefront of  cancer clinical research. The ACC Pediatric Oncology Program has played a central role locally and nationally  in improving our understanding of the biology of childhood cancers through the collection and study of human  tumor specimens, and in advancing our knowledge of optimal treatments by conducting clinical trials and  playing a very notable leadership role in national pediatric cooperative group and clinical research consortia.",26453799,

The overarching goals of the Core are to facilitate and support the use of high quality, advanced imaging modalities in clinical trials by providing easily accessed, reliable, reproducible, timely and validated imaging data and results in a timely and cost- effective manner. In addition to scientific imaging consultation, the Core provides protocol development services, standardized data acquisition methods for cancer imaging trials, and expert image response assessment analyses. The Core supports investigator access to a variety of cancer imaging methods, both standard clinical imaging studies and novel cancer imaging methods developed by Penn investigators, e.g., cancer imaging biomarker methods. The Core's objectives are to: 1) provide high quality consistent image acquisition processes and image analysis for cancer clinical trials involving imaging endpoints; 2) assist with protocol development, submission and activation of cancer clinical trials that involve imaging modalities; 3) provide scientific consultation to clinical investigators on the most appropriate cancer imaging methods to meet scientific needs; and 4) direct investigators to the appropriate choice of both standard and advanced imaging methodologies in ACC clinical investigations. Users and usage has steadily increased over the current project period, and seven of 11 ACC Programs are actively using the Core services in their scientific studies. The Core's ability to provide cost-effective, consistent, and timely quantitative image response assessment is made possible through new web-based tools. Recent changes include: 1) recruitment of an experienced new Co- Leader, Dr. David Mankoff; 2) expanded and more highly automated services for imaging response assessment and support for advanced imaging methods; 3) expanded capabilities in PET and molecular imaging, and 4) recruitment of seasoned Core staff with experience in cancer imaging core administration and imaging-related regulatory matters. Through its support of both standard imaging in cancer clinical trials and advanced imaging for ACC clinical trials, the Core is poised to lead the ACC into the next generation of clinical and translational research studies guided by quantitative cancer imaging. The current yearly rate of imaging response assessment is over 800 studies per year, involving 57 trials, of which 46 were initiated in the current year. A total of 120 new protocols and 31 different investigators, all of whom are ACC members, used the Core in the reporting period (10/01/13-9/30/14). CCSG support represents 33% of the proposed Core budget with the remaining funding coming from charge backs and other grants/contracts. Additional Institutional support is provided in the form of funding for the development of advanced imaging and image analysis methods.",26453799,

The goal of this process is to guide future directions, set priorities and prioritize investments of the  Center while, at the same time, providing ongoing mechanisms to monitor, assess and adjust research  progress, Programs, Shared Resources, allocations, and strategies. This cohesive process is supported by  highly integrated and effective bodies, such as the Senior Leaders, Executive Committee, Program Leaders,  Shared Resource Advisory Committees, and the External Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB), which provides  critical advice and feedback from experts. The Planning and Evaluation process has resulted in changes in  Program focus, development of new Cores, changes in clinical research operations, and prioritization of  Developmental Funds. Complementing these efforts are Programmatic, Divisional and Center-wide research  seminars, meetings and retreats that foster new interactions and collaborations with Penn colleagues and  external experts. Strategic planning is embedded in the ACC and Penn culture. The ACC plan of 2008-2013  set forth the goals for this period, including accelerating the translation of basic science discoveries into  investigator-initiated clinical trials, establishing a comprehensive molecular profiling and personalized medicine  initiative, enhancing behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk, and promoting translation of ACC research.  Soon after his appointment, the Center Director, Dr. Dang, defined his vision through 2020, and charged a  group to recommend strategies to realize the Center's goals in translational research and precision medicine.  A defining accomplishment has been $20M from the Institution to establish innovative transdisciplinary  programmatic efforts in translational cancer research, which are fueled by multi-year Institutional grants and  resources in high priority areas. Rigorous internal review of Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental  Funds, and strategic plan reviews by the ESAB ensure that the ACC continues to strive for excellence and  adheres to NCI guidelines.

Exposure to carcinogens represents a major cause of human  cancers yet individuals who have the same exposures do not all get cancer in the end-organ. This suggests  that significant inter-individual differences exist in cancer susceptibility. Understanding the basis of these  differences can lead to precision risk reduction, which represents the translational impact of the Program. The  foci of the Program is tobacco related cancers (e.g., lung) and asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, with a  developing effort in UV/light exposure and melanoma. Each area provides rich opportunities for inter-  Programmatic research. The Program owes its translational and transdisciplinary vision to Co-Leaders Drs.  Robert Schnoll, a leader in tobacco control, and Trevor Penning, an expert in environmental carcinogenesis.  The scientific aims of the Program are to: 1) Elucidate the pathways underlying exposure risk (e.g., risk factors  for tobacco dependence; environmental exposures and risk for mesothelioma and melanoma); 2) Identify the  mechanisms linking exposure to disease (e.g., steps in multi-stage carcinogenesis); 3) Evaluate methods for  exposure and risk reduction (e.g., tobacco cessation treatments; asbestos remediation; UV light protection);  and 4) Test methods of risk communication (e.g., tobacco marketing, regulatory science). Program members  collaborate extensively, particularly with the Cancer Control and Cancer Therapeutics Programs, on studies of  tobacco use, health communication, and smoking cessation, with the Cancer Therapeutics and Immunobiology  Programs on investigations in thoracic oncology and immunotherapies, and with the Melanoma and Cutaneous  Malignancies Program on UV/light issues. Seminal contributions during the project period include validating the  first genetically-informed biomarker for personalized smoking cessation treatment and identifying novel  mechanisms by which multi-organ carcinogens (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in tobacco smoke and  the environment are metabolically activated. The intra- and inter-Programmatic environment is facilitated by  active mentoring, symposia, working groups, and pilot grants. The 15 members, who are from five departments  and two schools, have $5.9M in external funding (annual direct costs); $5.8M is peer-reviewed and $2.6M is  NCI-funded.

Small animals provide invaluable model systems in a broad range of disciplines in cancer research including cancer biology, genetics, immunology, stem cell biology, and experimental therapeutics. Effective utilization of these models often demands application of non-invasive imaging methodologies. These techniques allow for longitudinal studies of disease progression and response to therapy as well as providing unique information that is not accessible via other methodologies. The major impediment to the effective application of these methodologies is that the highly specialized instrumentation and diverse expertise necessary is generally beyond the reach of the individual PI. The Small Animal Imaging Core is the ACC's NCI-approved Shared Resource that provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and a renowned faculty and technical support staff with the expertise necessary to apply a broad range of imaging modalities to small animal models. Supported modalities include magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, ultrasound imaging and optical/bioluminescence imaging. The Core provides limited animal housing for rats and mice, allowing multiple imaging sessions to be performed on a particular animal over an extended period without risking infection of the general population of animals. Since the last renewal, the Core has been physically consolidated, increasing proximity to ACC members. The new space facilitates the efficient application of multiple modalities to a given cohort of animals. In 2013, Dr. James Delikatny was appointed Core Director while Dr. Stephen Pickup continues as the Technical Director. The Core has four sub- Cores led by faculty with extensive experience in applying the respective imaging modality to small animals and nearly half of the users of the Core are ACC members.

Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS)  has been particularly helpful in supporting the conduct of high priority, innovative, pilot and/or Phase I clinical  trials. The pilot and Phase I trials that receive funding via this mechanism are of the highest priority for the ACC  as they often lay the groundwork for future efficacy studies. Trials supported by EPCRS include both traditional  ?investigator-initiated? studies of short duration (e.g., 1-2 years) and studies that result from collaborations with  industry in which the ACC investigator is the primary contributor to the design and conduct of the trial and often  has conducted the preclinical research that provided the rationale for the study.  The primary focus of EPCRS during the project period has been to enable the conduct of innovative early  phase trials. Funds have been used to support oncology research nurses and data managers for qualified,  carefully selected trials. Studies supported by EPCRS, while highly meritorious, are often unfunded or under-  funded, and thus unable to cover research nursing and/or data management costs adequately without such  support. In addition, EPCRS funded studies are generally complex, and usually include novel biological  correlative studies requiring expert study coordination. Consistent with this complexity, the EPCRS-supported  research nurses and data managers are among our most highly trained staff.

The Program is directly concerned with  improving cancer outcomes in the ACC's catchment area and working inter-Programmatically with all Research  Programs to apply advances in science to the health of populations. The members of the Program seek to  improve population health across the cancer spectrum through advancing science in the areas of: 1) Risk  Assessment; 2) Survivorship; 3) Communication and Health Behavior; and 4) Health Outcomes. The Program  has produced a substantial body of high impact work in the current project period. In the area of Risk  Assessment, members have led multiple groundbreaking studies which established the basis for clinical  management of women with BRCA1/2 mutations, identified risk loci associated with susceptibility to testicular  germ cell tumor and established genetic and genomic predictors of response to therapy in melanoma. In the  area of Survivorship, members have set clinical paradigms for cancer survivors through establishing care plans  and demonstrating that exercise programs improve outcomes. In the area of Communication and Health  Behavior, members are national leaders in health messaging and behavioral economics, with innovative  studies on use of incentives for improving health behaviors. In the area of Health Outcomes, members lead  critically important multidisciplinary studies on how research advances are translated into clinical practice and  address health care disparities within the ACC catchment area. The Program recruited 13 members in the  project period, with particularly important recruits in the area of ethical, legal and social implications of genetic  testing (Dr. Joffe), health communication and brain activity (Dr. Falk) and population-based cancer prevention  (Dr. Doubeni).

As such, the Core will enable the ACC to fulfill the growing needs of members who are using animal models. Amy Durham, MS, VMD, Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (DACVP) and Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathobiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, developed and directs the Core. Dr. Durham is a board- certified anatomic veterinary pathologist with considerable experience in animal models of cancer, and has been involved in numerous collaborative research projects with members of the ACC and others throughout the Penn campus. Recognition and accurate interpretation of gross and histopathological lesions in animal models is essential for the success of cancer research. Currently, Core pathologists work with ACC members from multiple Research Programs, including Tumor Biology, Cancer Therapeutics, Breast Cancer, Immunobiology, Radiobiology and Imaging, and Pediatric Oncology. Among the services that have been provided are: mouse phenotyping, comprehensive slide evaluation and interpretation, consultation, autopsy training, and photomicroscopy. Additional services utilize the Core's histology laboratory to provide histopathology slide preparation, as well as special histochemical and immunohistochemical staining. Working with the Facility Director, Dr. Durham, is Dr. Elizabeth Buza, who is the Core's Technical Director and lead pathologist. Dr. Buza has expertise in mouse pathology and additional training in mouse models of disease from Novartis and Jackson Labs, and she has worked with Dr. Durham for several years.

Establishment of latent infection in B-lymphocytes and persistent infection in endothelial cells is thought to be a major driving force for KSHV-associated disease. Establishment of latent infection requires the formation of a stable circular minichromosome that expresses a limited set of viral genes. The mechanisms that establish minichromosome formation and restrict gene expression to the latency class are not well understood. Our previously published studies indicate that chromatin boundary factors, like CTCF, organize viral chromosome structure and histone modification patterns important for genome stability and restricted gene expression. CTCF interacts with cohesins (e.g. SMCl, SMC3, Rad21) to form higher order DNA conformations that are important for chromosome transmission during cell division and for coordinated transcription regulation. Recent studies from our group revealed that CTCF-cohesins mediate Interactions between the latent and lytic control regions of KSHV genomes in latently infected PEL cells. New preliminary data indicate that lytic immediate early genes are coordinately regulated through a chromatin structure involving CTCF and cohesins, and that cohesins are required for suppression of lytic gene transcription. Furthermore, CTCF binding sites are located in close proximity to RBP-jK sites at the lytic and latent control regions. Since RBP-jK is a primary target of KSHV immediate early protein Rta and latency maintenance protein LANA, we will explore how these proteins (e.g. RBP-jK, Rta, K8, and LANA) may interact with arid regulate CTGF-cohesion function. We will also investigate the role of host intrinsic defense proteins in regulating viral chromatin assembly. Finally, we will explore the role of LANA and KSHV infection on viral and host chromosome structure and epigenetic: modifications. These aims will synergize with projects 1 & 2 of this program project, and provide both molecular and genome-wide analyses of chromatin control mechanisms during the early stages of KSHV infection and in the establishment of KSHV latency.",25894481,

KS of the soft palate as well as major involvement of the body and extremities has been known to be a common symptom associated with the onset of AIDS in the HIV immunocompromised population. This has become a pandemic and KS as well as pleural effusion lymphomas are now included as the leading causes of death in the HIV population in developing countries. KSHV was identified 15 years ago and has been tackled mostly on a level of the individual investigator. The focus of this application is to bring together 3 prominent groups of investigators within the University of Pennsylvania community to join their scientific expertise to address the mechanism of KSHV mediated oncogenesis. The overall goal will be to investigate the mechanism of viral control by encoded antigens during the early stages of infection of primary B cells. The fundamental cellular processes targeted during these early stages will provide novel new information as to the strict requirements for successful establishment of latency by the virus.      The program consists of three scientific projects, an administrative core, a recombineering virus and vector core and a ChIP sequencing core. The scientific projects are: 1. The Role of the RBPJk-LANA complex during early infection; 2. KSHV abortive replication following de novo infection; 3. Chromatin regulation of KSHV during early infection of primary B-cells.      The success of these projects will allow for the establishment of a more comprehensive mechanistic view of KSHV infection and pathogenesis and provide new clues for the development of strategies to prevent and treat KSHV associated cancers in the HIV population. In addition the accumulation of new information on KSHV biology will be critical for the broader area of herpesvirus biology with insights into the mechanism of oncogenesis associated with other viruses including EBV and so reducing the burden of disease in the HIV infected, transplants and other immunocompromised population",25894481,

The detailed process and the mechanism underlying the establishment of latent infection remain elusive. After a KSHV particle enters a host cell, the virus undergoes DNA replication which results in accumulation of the viral genome to 50-100 copies per cell prior to establishment of latency. Little is known regarding the mode of the abortive viral replication and the regulation mechanism. ORF KS encodes a nuclear protein of the bZip family. Our study using K8-null recombinant virus demonstrated a role of KS in initial viral DNA replication following de novo KSHV Infection. KS-null viruses exhibit much lower viral genome copy numbers in comparison to wild type viruses when infecting 293T, HFF and HMVEC cells. The role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection provides insights into the so-called abortive viral replication. In this study, we will follow the functional role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection to investigate the process of abortive viral replication that leads to establishment of latency and the mechanism controlling this process. In particular, (1) we will explore the role of K8 in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. We will test three non-exclusive models for the role of KB in this event: (i) K8 releases LANA-mediated ori-|yt-dependent viral DNA replication; (ii) K8 recruits the proteins required for abortive lytic DNA replication, viral or cellular inclusive of viral DMA polymerase; (iii) K8 represses some genes and activates other genes through epigenetic regulation of KSHV genome to facilitate effective abortive viral replication. (2) We will study the nature of abortive lytic replication in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. This may represent the third mode of viral DNA replication. We will study this crucial event by addressing the following questions: (i) Is the KSHV ori-Lyt involved in the abortive DNA replication? (ii) What mode of DNA replication is employed in the abortive lytic replication (3)?  We will infect human PBMC with KSHV and analyze the contributions of K8 and other viral factors to the abortive replication that leads to establishment of latency in B cells.

260,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1ÃÂ± (HIF-1ÃÂ±) has been frequently implicated in many cancers as well as viral pathogenesis. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to several human malignancies.

However, the mechanism by which KSHV controls its latent and lytic life cycle through the deregulation of HIF-1ÃÂ± is not fully understood. Our previous studies showed that the hypoxia-sensitive chromatin remodeler KAP1 was targeted by the KSHV-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) to repress expression of the major lytic replication and transcriptional activator (RTA). Here we further report that an RNA interference-based knockdown of KAP1 in KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells disrupted viral episome stability and abrogated sub-G1/G1 arrest of the cell cycle while increasing the efficiency of KSHV lytic reactivation by hypoxia or using the chemical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or sodium butyrate (NaB). Moreover, KSHV genome-wide screening revealed that four hypoxia-responsive clusters have a high concurrence of both RBP-JÃÂº and HIF-1ÃÂ± binding sites (RBS+HRE) within the same gene promoter and are tightly associated with KAP1. Inhibition of KAP1 greatly enhanced the association of RBP-JÃÂº with the HIF-1ÃÂ± complex for driving RTA expression not only in normoxia but also in hypoxia. These results suggest that both KAP1 and the concurrence of RBS+HRE within the RTA promoter are essential for KSHV latency and hypoxia-induced lytic reactivation.","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The GhlP-Seq Production core will be responsible for 1) performing ChlP-assays; 2) generating library for lllumina next-generation sequencing, 3) mapping sequence data to KSHV and human genomes, and 4) providing follow-up bioinformatics analyses.

Establishment of latent infection in B-lymphocytes and persistent infection in endothelial cells is thought to be a major driving force for KSHV-associated disease. Establishment of latent infection requires the formation of a stable circular minichromosome that expresses a limited set of viral genes. The mechanisms that establish minichromosome formation and restrict gene expression to the latency class are not well understood. Our previously published studies indicate that chromatin boundary factors, like CTCF, organize viral chromosome structure and histone modification patterns important for genome stability and restricted gene expression. CTCF interacts with cohesins (e.g. SMCl, SMC3, Rad21) to form higher order DNA conformations that are important for chromosome transmission during cell division and for coordinated transcription regulation. Recent studies from our group revealed that CTCF-cohesins mediate Interactions between the latent and lytic control regions of KSHV genomes in latently infected PEL cells. New preliminary data indicate that lytic immediate early genes are coordinately regulated through a chromatin structure involving CTCF and cohesins, and that cohesins are required for suppression of lytic gene transcription. Furthermore, CTCF binding sites are located in close proximity to RBP-jK sites at the lytic and latent control regions. Since RBP-jK is a primary target of KSHV immediate early protein Rta and latency maintenance protein LANA, we will explore how these proteins (e.g. RBP-jK, Rta, K8, and LANA) may interact with arid regulate CTGF-cohesion function. We will also investigate the role of host intrinsic defense proteins in regulating viral chromatin assembly. Finally, we will explore the role of LANA and KSHV infection on viral and host chromosome structure and epigenetic: modifications. These aims will synergize with projects 1 & 2 of this program project, and provide both molecular and genome-wide analyses of chromatin control mechanisms during the early stages of KSHV infection and in the establishment of KSHV latency.",24696491,

KS of the soft palate as well as major involvement of the body and extremities has been known to be a common symptom associated with the onset of AIDS in the HIV immunocompromised population. This has become a pandemic and KS as well as pleural effusion lymphomas are now included as the leading causes of death in the HIV population in developing countries. KSHV was identified 15 years ago and has been tackled mostly on a level of the individual investigator. The focus of this application is to bring together 3 prominent groups of investigators within the University of Pennsylvania community to join their scientific expertise to address the mechanism of KSHV mediated oncogenesis. The overall goal will be to investigate the mechanism of viral control by encoded antigens during the early stages of infection of primary B cells. The fundamental cellular processes targeted during these early stages will provide novel new information as to the strict requirements for successful establishment of latency by the virus.      The program consists of three scientific projects, an administrative core, a recombineering virus and vector core and a ChIP sequencing core. The scientific projects are: 1. The Role of the RBPJk-LANA complex during early infection; 2. KSHV abortive replication following de novo infection; 3. Chromatin regulation of KSHV during early infection of primary B-cells.      The success of these projects will allow for the establishment of a more comprehensive mechanistic view of KSHV infection and pathogenesis and provide new clues for the development of strategies to prevent and treat KSHV associated cancers in the HIV population. In addition the accumulation of new information on KSHV biology will be critical for the broader area of herpesvirus biology with insights into the mechanism of oncogenesis associated with other viruses including EBV and so reducing the burden of disease in the HIV infected, transplants and other immunocompromised population",24696491,

The detailed process and the mechanism underlying the establishment of latent infection remain elusive. After a KSHV particle enters a host cell, the virus undergoes DNA replication which results in accumulation of the viral genome to 50-100 copies per cell prior to establishment of latency. Little is known regarding the mode of the abortive viral replication and the regulation mechanism. ORF KS encodes a nuclear protein of the bZip family. Our study using K8-null recombinant virus demonstrated a role of KS in initial viral DNA replication following de novo KSHV Infection. KS-null viruses exhibit much lower viral genome copy numbers in comparison to wild type viruses when infecting 293T, HFF and HMVEC cells. The role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection provides insights into the so-called abortive viral replication. In this study, we will follow the functional role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection to investigate the process of abortive viral replication that leads to establishment of latency and the mechanism controlling this process. In particular, (1) we will explore the role of K8 in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. We will test three non-exclusive models for the role of KB in this event: (i) K8 releases LANA-mediated ori-|yt-dependent viral DNA replication; (ii) K8 recruits the proteins required for abortive lytic DNA replication, viral or cellular inclusive of viral DMA polymerase; (iii) K8 represses some genes and activates other genes through epigenetic regulation of KSHV genome to facilitate effective abortive viral replication. (2) We will study the nature of abortive lytic replication in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. This may represent the third mode of viral DNA replication. We will study this crucial event by addressing the following questions: (i) Is the KSHV ori-Lyt involved in the abortive DNA replication? (ii) What mode of DNA replication is employed in the abortive lytic replication (3)?  We will infect human PBMC with KSHV and analyze the contributions of K8 and other viral factors to the abortive replication that leads to establishment of latency in B cells. This study may leads to new strategy to interfere with KSHV life cycle aiming at efficacious treatment of KSHV-associated diseases.",24696491,

The overall goal will be to investigate the mechanism of viral control by encoded antigens during the early stages of infection of primary B cells. The fundamental cellular processes targeted during these early stages will provide novel new information as to the strict requirements for successful establishment of latency by the virus.      The program consists of three scientific projects, an administrative core, a recombineering virus and vector core and a ChIP sequencing core. The scientific projects are: 1. The Role of the RBPJk-LANA complex during early infection; 2. KSHV abortive replication following de novo infection; 3. Chromatin regulation of KSHV during early infection of primary B-cells.      The success of these projects will allow for the establishment of a more comprehensive mechanistic view of KSHV infection and pathogenesis and provide new clues for the development of strategies to prevent and treat KSHV associated cancers in the HIV population. In addition the accumulation of new information on KSHV biology will be critical for the broader area of herpesvirus biology with insights into the mechanism of oncogenesis associated with other viruses including EBV and so reducing the burden of disease in the HIV infected, transplants and other immunocompromised population",24278015,
272,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor ÃÂ± (HIF-1ÃÂ±) during latent infection, and HIF-1ÃÂ± reactivates lytic replication under hypoxic stress. However, the mechanism utilized by KSHV to block lytic reactivation with the accumulation of HIF-1ÃÂ± in latency remains unclear. Here, we report that LANA encoded by KSHV contains a unique SUMO-interacting motif (LANA(SIM)) which is specific for interaction with SUMO-2 and facilitates LANA SUMOylation at lysine 1140. Proteomic and co-immunoprecipitation analysis further reveal that the SUMO-2 modified transcription repressor KAP1 is a critical factor recruited by LANA(SIM). Deletion of LANA(SIM) led to functional loss of both LANA-mediated viral episome maintenance and lytic gene silencing. Moreover, hypoxia reduced KAP1 SUMOylation and resulted in dissociation of both KAP1 and Sin3A repressors from LANA(SIM)-associated complex. Therefore, the LANA(SIM) motif plays an essential role in KSHV latency and is a potential drug target against KSHV-associated cancers.","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  KSHV infects B lymphocytes and establishes a predominantly latent infection. The detailed process and the mechanism underlying the establishment of latent infection remain elusive. After a KSHV particle enters a host cell, the virus undergoes DNA replication which results in accumulation of the viral genome to 50-100 copies per cell prior to establishment of latency. Little is known regarding the mode of the abortive viral replication and the regulation mechanism. ORF KS encodes a nuclear protein of the bZip family. Our study using K8-null recombinant virus demonstrated a role of KS in initial viral DNA replication following de novo KSHV Infection. KS-null viruses exhibit much lower viral genome copy numbers in comparison to wild type viruses when infecting 293T, HFF and HMVEC cells. The role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection provides insights into the so-called abortive viral replication. In this study, we will follow the functional role of K8 in the early stage of de novo infection to investigate the process of abortive viral replication that leads to establishment of latency and the mechanism controlling this process. In particular, (1) we will explore the role of K8 in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. We will test three non-exclusive models for the role of KB in this event: (i) K8 releases LANA-mediated ori-|yt-dependent viral DNA replication; (ii) K8 recruits the proteins required for abortive lytic DNA replication, viral or cellular inclusive of viral DMA polymerase; (iii) K8 represses some genes and activates other genes through epigenetic regulation of KSHV genome to facilitate effective abortive viral replication. (2) We will study the nature of abortive lytic replication in the early stage of KSHV primary infection. This may represent the third mode of viral DNA replication. We will study this crucial event by addressing the following questions: (i) Is the KSHV ori-Lyt involved in the abortive DNA replication? (ii) What mode of DNA replication is employed in the abortive lytic replication (3)?  We will infect human PBMC with KSHV and analyze the contributions of K8 and other viral factors to the abortive replication that leads to establishment of latency in B cells. This study may leads to new strategy to interfere with KSHV life cycle aiming at efficacious treatment of KSHV-associated diseases.",24278015,

In the; HIV positive immunocompromised patients, pleural effusion lymphoma (PELs), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD) are common. The associated human malignancy is a major contributor to increased mortality in developing countries in this population of HIV positive patients. This study will explore the mechanisms by which KiSHV encoded LANA interacts with the cellular transcription regulator RBP-Jk during the early stages of de novo infection of human primary B cells. We will determine the role ofthe LANA and RBP-Jk complex during early infection where the regulatory functions of this complex is likely to play a critical role in establishment of latency. We will determine the epigenetic state of the RBP-Jk and LANA binding sites during the early infection and establishment of latency and determine how LANA modulates the DNA damage proteins DNA-PK, ATM, ATR and regulate early infection. We will determine the requirement for the latent antigen LANA in establishment and maintenance of KSHV latency specifically as it relates to modification of LANA and its interacting partner RBP-Jk the cellular transcription regulator. In this application we will focus; on the early events during primary B cell infection and the requirements needed for successful establishment of latency. Studies in our lab has demonstrated that LANA is in fact phosphorylated but we do not yet understand the precise need for phosphorylation as a perquisite for second site phosphorylation, or ubiquitination of LANA. We will undertake the broad aim to identify the cellular targets regulated as it relates to the phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination of LANA. Specific mutations in the major latency sites on the KSHV genome will be used along with the wild type molecules and these will be further tested in assays including transcription, cell growth and proliferation. These studies will further our understanding of KSHV latency mechanisms and provide insights for therapeutic potential by targeting the pathways activated in these cells.",24278015,

Within the U.S., African Americans (31.1% of blacks are obese compared to 19.6% of whites) and Southern rural residents bear some of the highest burdens of the obesity epidemic. Obesity interventions targeting rural, African American groups are essential to address disparities in health. Weight loss improves obesity-related risk factors and prevents the development of obesity-related comorbidities, and weight loss interventions have shown improvements in these outcomes. However, the positive effects of weight loss tend to diminish unless weight loss is maintained. Several multi-center efficacy trials of lifestyle modification for obesity have reported significant and sustained weight loss for diverse groups. However, there has been very little work in the translation of evidence-based weight loss and maintenance interventions into regular practice settings, such as the community.

Stewart and Kevin W.  Ryan, builds upon the substantial success of our innovative partnerships with the three Historically Black  Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) in Arkansas to increase awareness of the fields of public health and  disparities research among HBCU students, develop combined BA/MPH and BS/MPH (4+1) degree  programs that identify talented HBCU undergraduates and facilitate their early entry into graduate study in  public health, provide students with crucial research skills, and support mentoring relationships for these  students with ARCHD faculty. It also builds upon the successes of the COPH in developing several courses  focused on racial disparities, social determinants of health, and community-based public health (CBPH), and in  identifying, recruiting, and mentoring African-American graduate students and faculty. Working from these  strengths, the ETC's overarching goal during the proposed funding period will be to establish a sustainable  infrastructure to support outreach to and development of talented minority scholars at the undergraduate,  graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty levels, including increased exposure to coursework in health disparities  and CBPH, mentored research experience in these areas, and training in research skills and responsible  conduct of research.    The Sullivan Commission and Institute of Medicine, among others, have persuasively argued that  increasing the representation of under-represented minority (URM) students and faculty in the health  professions is a crucial aspect of addressing health disparities (Sullivan Commission, 2004; lOM, 2004), yet  African-American scholars remain under-represented at all levels of higher education in public health. This  disparity increases from undergraduate degrees through graduate education and into the faculty ranks, so that  African-Americans represent only 5% of doctoral-level graduates from public health degree programs (Mitchell  & Lassiter, 2006) and only 3% of tenured faculty in accredited schools of public health (ASPH, 2009).  However, programs that provide structured support for students and faculty, including involvement of students  in research, provision of academic support to students and professional development to faculty, and training in  strong instructional strategies, have significantly improved students' enrollment in and completion of graduate  degree programs in scientific fields (Clewell, de Cohen, & Tsui, 2010).

Within the U.S., African Americans (31.1% of blacks are obese compared to 19.6% of whites) and Southern rural residents bear some of the highest burdens of the obesity epidemic. Obesity interventions targeting rural, African American groups are essential to address disparities in health. Weight loss improves obesity-related risk factors and prevents the development of obesity-related comorbidities, and weight loss interventions have shown improvements in these outcomes. However, the positive effects of weight loss tend to diminish unless weight loss is maintained. Several multi-center efficacy trials of lifestyle modification for obesity have reported significant and sustained weight loss for diverse groups. However, there has been very little work in the translation of evidence-based weight loss and maintenance interventions into regular practice settings, such as the community.

Stewart and Kevin W.  Ryan, builds upon the substantial success of our innovative partnerships with the three Historically Black  Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) in Arkansas to increase awareness of the fields of public health and  disparities research among HBCU students, develop combined BA/MPH and BS/MPH (4+1) degree  programs that identify talented HBCU undergraduates and facilitate their early entry into graduate study in  public health, provide students with crucial research skills, and support mentoring relationships for these  students with ARCHD faculty. It also builds upon the successes of the COPH in developing several courses  focused on racial disparities, social determinants of health, and community-based public health (CBPH), and in  identifying, recruiting, and mentoring African-American graduate students and faculty. Working from these  strengths, the ETC's overarching goal during the proposed funding period will be to establish a sustainable  infrastructure to support outreach to and development of talented minority scholars at the undergraduate,  graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty levels, including increased exposure to coursework in health disparities  and CBPH, mentored research experience in these areas, and training in research skills and responsible  conduct of research.    The Sullivan Commission and Institute of Medicine, among others, have persuasively argued that  increasing the representation of under-represented minority (URM) students and faculty in the health  professions is a crucial aspect of addressing health disparities (Sullivan Commission, 2004; lOM, 2004), yet  African-American scholars remain under-represented at all levels of higher education in public health. This  disparity increases from undergraduate degrees through graduate education and into the faculty ranks, so that  African-Americans represent only 5% of doctoral-level graduates from public health degree programs (Mitchell  & Lassiter, 2006) and only 3% of tenured faculty in accredited schools of public health (ASPH, 2009).  However, programs that provide structured support for students and faculty, including involvement of students  in research, provision of academic support to students and professional development to faculty, and training in  strong instructional strategies, have significantly improved students' enrollment in and completion of graduate  degree programs in scientific fields (Clewell, de Cohen, & Tsui, 2010).

Although based in the COPH, ARCHD has engaged faculty across UAMS who are either involved in minority health disparities research or who are interested in developing health disparities research programs. Strong institutional support is demonstrated not only by the COPH Dean (Dr. Raczynski) serving as Pl/PD but also by strong support from UAMS Chancellor Rahn and commitment of funding to match the indirect costs generated by ARCHD (approximately $450,000 annually) as discretionary funds. ARCHD was originally founded in October 2007 with an initial 8-month fiscal year. Hence, the Center has been only funded for approximately 3 1/2 calendar years when this application was submitted. Despite this short period and most funded research projects on-going with no results yet available, ARCHD Pilot Research Projects have already resulted in 3 NIH awards (2 ROIs and 1 R03). Dr. Yeary's Research Project proposed in this continuation application is based on a 4th Pilot Research Project. The overall theme for this continuation application remains: to develop research that improves access to quality prevention and healthcare programs for racial and ethnic minorities with a goal of eliminating health disparities. ARCHD will continue to focus on chronic disease disparities with an emphasis on significant epidemic chronic disease risk factors and the management of other chronic disease risk factors that lead to excess morbidity, mortality and costs through institutional placements. Four mandatory core units are proposed (Administrative, Education/Training, Research, Community Engagement). In addition, two research projects are proposed: Holly Felix, PhD, PI - Effect of community health workers compared to standard outreach for long-term care services, a comparative effectiveness evaluation of a program for long-term care prevention; and Karen Kim Yeary, PhD, PI -Weight loss and maintenance for rural, African American communities of faith, a community-based participatory, faith-based, lay health advisor intervention for rural African Americans.",25346379,
